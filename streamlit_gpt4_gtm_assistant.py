Write a natural, concise explanation for a sales rep on why this account is at this readiness score, highlighting the most important factors.

Some explanation on the existing features in the dataset for context:
- Engagement Score is out of 100. A score below 50 is considered weak and should be improved through customer success engagement. Closer to 0 is really bad and closer to 100 is really good.
- If Event Attendance is No, recommend inviting the account to relevant events to boost engagement.
- If Usage Trend is Down, suggest promoting product feature usage and providing enablement training.
- If Expansion Potential = 0, it indicates the account already spends a large proportion (>10%) of its revenue on Rubrik, suggesting strong current commitment. Upsell opportunities might be limited unless new product offerings are introduced.
- If Expansion Potential = 1, there is opportunity to upsell based on unused budget.
- If Renewal Date is within the next 90 days, that is a positive opportunity for renewal discussions.
